### TODO

- Fix the delete repositories error
- Python dependencies:
  - Automatically check & install dependencies after the python path is changed
  - A tooltip to show all the dependencies needed
- Model Improvements:
  - Check for feature selection
  - Covariance matrix (EllipticEnvelope)
- Improve the UI
- Test finding the git author


- Validation:
  - Compare with intellij Extract Method Refactoring

Future work:
- Add Extract Class
- More data - script that uses high computing resources
- Incremental training (for the thesis future work section as it is very hard)
- Synchronize profiles between different machines (again, thesis future work section)
- Try and find a place to publish a paper - find events in the next few months
