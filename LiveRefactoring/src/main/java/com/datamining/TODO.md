### TODO

- Improve the UI:
  - A tooltip to show all the python dependencies needed
  - Improve the size of the buttons and the text inputs
- Model Improvements:
  - Check for feature selection
  - Covariance matrix (EllipticEnvelope)


- Validation:
  - Compare with intellij Extract Method Refactoring
  - NEED TO FIND MORE STUFF -> maybe a collection of refactorings that already exist for testing purposes

Future work:
- More data - script that uses high computing resources
- Incremental training (for the thesis future work section as it is very hard)
- Synchronize profiles between different machines (again, thesis future work section)
